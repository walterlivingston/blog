My name is Walter Livingston and I am graduate student in Mechanical Engineering at Auburn University. I primarily work in the field of navigation, more specifically gnss-denied navigation. The primary reason I am creating this blog is to act as a place to put topics, how-to guides, etc. that I have researched and struggled to find resources on. Hopefully, it will save people at least a few hours of research and be a succinct, reusable resource.
## My Interests
There will probably be posts here on a variety of topics. Some of the most common ones may include:
- Inertial Navigation
- Optimal Estimation
- Programming

These are my main occupational interests. Some other topics I may post about, given I feel that I have something of note to say in them are:
- Bible Study
- Theology
- Literature
- Home Projects
- Dungeons & Dragons

Overall, this blog will just be a catch-all of ideas that I have with no other outlet to put them in. I hope this is useful, and if you do find it to be, please leave comments and let me know! Also, feel free to correct me wherever I have gotten something wrong or where you may disagree. I hope this will be a place of learning for me as well as for anyone reading these posts.
## About Me
As mentioned previously, I am currently a graduate student in Mechanical Engineering at Auburn University, hoping to write and defend my thesis this year. I am a husband and a father of two boys (one is on the way). I enjoy reading books, playing Dungeons & Dragons, watching movies with my wife Shelby, and playing with my youngest son Laurie. I will probably have a post here or there about some of these things such as D&D.
